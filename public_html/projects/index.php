				<h3>Bowl Turning</h3>

				<p>I recently decided to teach myself how to turn wood bowls. Here are some turnings which resulted from the
					process.</p><br><br>

				<br><h4>Pine Knitting Bowls</h4>
				<p>These were some knitting bowls I made for my sisters. They were my first attempt at turning deep bowls.
				<p>The wood was
					Ponderosa Pine a friend was using as firewood.</p>
				<p>I meant them only as practice, but my sisters wanted them anyway.</p><br><br>

				<h4>Peach Bowl</h4>
				<p>This project is still ongoing.</p>
				<p>The wood is from an old peach tree root ball.</p>
				<p>My initial cutting tools were not good
					for this project so I set it aside until my tools are up to the cut. It smelled nice
					while creating shavings.</p><br><br>

				<h4>Oak Bowl</h4>
				<p>An oak bowl I did from a turning blank I bought.</p>
				<p>The dark wood has very open cells and did not finish well.</p>
				<p>The
					texture was a little rough, but overall it was a good learning experience. </p><br><br>

				<br>
				<h4>Mesquite Bowl</h4>
				<p>This was my favorite bowl so far.</p>
				<p>The wood is mesquite and was also from a turning blank.</p>
				<p>The wood was very fun
					to turn but was hard to get a finish I liked.</p>
				<p>The dark area of wood with the hole in it, in the top picture, is from larvae
					that bored holes in the wood.</p>
				<p>I am still learning how to finish these projects to get a look I like.</p><br><br>

					<h4>Willow Bowl</h4>
					<p>This was a gift to my physical therapy staff after rehab for a shoulder strain.</p>
					<p>It is made from willow and also
						turned nicely.</p>
					<p>The finish is just wax as it was for putting candy in. It was a fun way to say thanks.</p>
