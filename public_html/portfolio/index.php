				<h4>ROMuLess.com</h4>
				<p>This web application is the capstone project for Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp. As part of a team of 3, I
					have
					worked on both the front end and back end of the application. Our assignment was to create an e-commerce
					website for the buying and selling of gaming cartridges. It is an ongoing project which I am working on.
					We used PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, Bootstrap and AngularJS 1.</p>

				<h4>wyn-tech.com</h4>
				<p>This is my personal website. This is an ongoing fun project that was part of Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp.
					This
					was
					an exercise where we were allowed to be creative. It has a home, background, portfolio and contact page.
					I
					added a page to it that shows some of my woodturning projects I was able to do recently. I wrote it
					using HTML, CSS3, Bootstrap and AngularJS 1.</p>

				<h4>ABQ-parks</h4>
				<p>This is an app I have been working on in my spare time. It shows the various parks available in
					Albuquerque, New Mexico. As a future capability, I want to add the ability to use your location to give
					you a
					list of nearby parks.</p>

				<h4>Angular Attack 2016</h4>
				<p>As part of a team of 4, I participated in Angular Attack 2016 on May 14 and 15. This was an international
					hackathon that
					ran for 48hrs where we
					were to create an app in Angular. We worked on an app that would show the New Mexico RailRunner
					schedules. We
					had a lot of fun during the hackathon and used the opportunity to gain knowledge in Angular 2.  The project is still ongoing as we find time.</p>
