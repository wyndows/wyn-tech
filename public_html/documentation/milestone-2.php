		<h2>Wyn-Tech.com Milestone 2&alpha</h2>
		<h3>Proposed Site Map</h3>
		<p>Site will consist of 3 top-level pages total. No sub-pages or sub-navigation. This will be the Minimum Viable Product.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Home Page</li>
			<li>About Me / Contact</li>
			<li>Portfolio</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Content Strategy</h3>
		<p><strong>Home Page: </strong>A brief introduction that clearly states my name and role as a Web Developer, and will feature 2 calls to action that will direct the user to 		the About Me or the Portfolio page.</p>
		<p><strong>About Me: </strong>This page will detail my professional history, core skill set, and professional highlights. This page will showcase my strengths and personality. 		I will feature a contrasting sidebar that lists my core skills which will be easily 		readable at a glance. The tone of voice will be personable and casual, as I am only 		interested in opportunities with individuals and organizations that I am a good 		personality fit for. This will be a moving text area as my contact info will be locked 		at	the bottom of the page</p>
		<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>1 -2 examples of my past work, including my roles and contributions to each project. I want this to be an animated, responsive image gallery.</p>
		<h3>Interaction Flow</h3>
		<p>Christa is viewing the site on her phone. She goes to wyn-tech.com and is shown the Home Page. In the next 3 minutes, here is an outline of Christaâ€™s interactions with the 		site:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Lands on Home page. Touches menu and a dropdown shows with Home, About and Portfolio.</li>
			<li>Views the two projects in Portfolio gallery. Finds work satisfactory. Navigates to the "About Me" page via the main navigation in the header.</li>
			<li>1 minute look at the About Me page. Sees core skills featured in a contrasting side panel. The interaction stops here. Christa has decided, based on the information 			provided, that she will be contacting me regarding the website for Decor8-on-a-dime</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Wireframes</h3>
		<p>This site will feature 2 layouts:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Home Page Layout</li>
			<li>Content Page Layout</li>
		</ol>
