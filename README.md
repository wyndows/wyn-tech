## Milestone 1 Feedback 
Your purpose, audience, goal, persona and use case are all sufficiently defined, although there is room for further detail and development of the key points. Your project is set up correctly, and your HTML looks good. 

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

We will be discussing Milestone 2&alpha; in the weeks to come, so hold off on further work until the next phase is covered in class.
