Personal Web Page Project

## Milestone 1 Feedback 
Your purpose, audience, goal, persona and use case are all sufficiently defined, although there is room for further detail and development of the key points. Your project is set up correctly, and your HTML looks good. 

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

We will be discussing Milestone 2&alpha; in the weeks to come, so hold off on further work until the next phase is covered in class.

## Milestone 2a Feedback
Your site map, content strategy and interaction flow are all sufficiently defined, and your wireframes are detailed enough as to provide you with a good guide for your front end development.

Keeping your contact info in the footer is a good idea - but plan to also include an HTML contact form somewhere in your site. This is a PWP requirement, and will be PHP driven using Swiftmailer.

Really think about how you would like to feature and present your portfolio content specifically. Of course this will depend on what kind of content you plan on featuring. Having a specific plan for the layout of your portfolio items  will inform your HTML structure and if any 3rd party tools might be appropriate.

A jQuery driven gallery plugin that many students have had success with is the [Swipebox Gallery](http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/). We like it because  it works well on mobile and is Bootstrap friendly.

Your HTML looks good overall. Beware of spaces in between your HTML attributes and values. 

For example: 

**GOOD**: `<div id="contentdesktop">` **BAD**: `<div id = "contentdesktop">`

Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are clear to begin development on your PWP.

## Milestone 3 Feedback
Excellent work here Marlan. Your PWP is well planned, well designed, well coded and achieves all of the goals and objectives outlined in Milestone 1. You have demonstrated an above-average skill set with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap here. Excellent work with the form, and +100 for the SSL. Congratulations on a PWP well done. Your Milestone 3/Final PWP passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- See if you can get the .htaccess in place on ASO to redirect the user to /public_html and clean up the URL.
- Your URLs will appear a little cleaner in you direct your nav links to the appropriate sudirectory only, and leave off the "index.php" references.
